Breast Cancer Detection with SVM and KNN.

**Proceedures involved**:
  
    • Imported data from the UCI repository.
  
    • Named the columns with the features and added them to a pandas dataframe.
  
    • Preprossessed the data.
  
    • Removed the ID column.
  
    • Explored the data to understand more about it.
  
    • Histogram it, so I could understand the distribution of the different features.
  
    • Scatter matrix, so I could look for linear relationships between some of the features.
  
    • Split the data into two sets: Training and Testing Valitadion.
  
    • Built a KNN classifier and a SV Classifier and compared the results using a classification report.
  
    • Built a cell in order to explore what it would take to get a benign or malignant classification.
